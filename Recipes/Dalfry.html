            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Dal fry is a popular Indian lentil dish where soft cooked toor dal (Skinned Split pigeon peas) aka lentils are simmered with a fried tempering consisting of ghee, whole and ground spices, onions, tomatoes and herbs. There is actually no deep frying involved in the process of making dal fry, but the tempering is fried in 1 to 2 tablespoons ghee or oil to bring out the aroma of various aromatic ingredients.</p>
            <p2>Though the dish can be made with any lentils of your choice like moong dal, chana dal or masoor dal, Toor dal (split pigeon peas) are most widely used. In restaurants a combination of toor dal and masoor dal is used.</p2>
             <h3>ingredients</h3>
             <ul><li>Veggies: You will need an onion and tomato, both finely chopped for this dal recipe.</li>
               <li> Green Chilies: Not as hot as jalapeños but just the right level of spice for the dish.
                </li>
               <li>Curry Leaves: The subtle flavor of curry leaves are essential in this recipe. But if you don’t have it, then might well as skip it – though some flavor profile will be amiss.
              </li>
               <li> Asafoetida Powder (hing): If using a strong asafoetida, then just one pinch is enough. I would definitely recommend adding a small amount at a time and seasoning to taste. And if you do not have asafoetida, then simply skip it.
            </li>
               <li> Coriander leaves (cilantro): This simple herb brings a much needed hint of freshness to the Dal Fry.
            </li>
              <li>  Kasuri Methi (dry fenugreek leaves): Brings restaurant style flavors to the dal and gives a nutty aroma. Skip if you do not have it.
              </li>
                Additional Seasonings: You will also need several Indian pantry staples, including ginger, black mustard seeds, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, Garam Masala powder, oil, lemon juice, and salt.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
               <li> 1- Rinse the dal (I used mix of toor and masoor) and transfer to an instant pot or pressure cooker. Add 1/2 teaspoon turmeric, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 3 cups water. Stir.
               </li>
              <li> 2- Boil the dal using either-
            
                Instant Pot: cook on high pressure for 8 minutes with natural pressure release.
                
                Stove-top pressure cooker: cook for 4 to 5 whistles on high then lower the heat and let it cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside</li>
                
                <li>  3- Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle. Then add dried red chili and hing and saute for few seconds.
                </li>
                    <li>  4- Add onions (also add 1/4 teaspoon salt for the onions to cook faster) and cook for around 4 minutes until soft and light golden brown in color.

            </li>
                <li>    5- Add crushed garlic-ginger and sliced green chili. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the raw smell goes away.
                </li>
                    <li>   6- Add chopped tomatoes and stir.
                    </li>
                        <li>  7- Then add the garam masala, red chili powder and mix. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes until tomatoes are very soft and cooked and oil oozes from the side of the masala.
                        </li>
                            <li>  8- This step is important, don’t rush it. Stir in between and I also added around 2 tablespoon water so that the masala doesn’t burn.

                <li>  9- Now add the boiled dal to the pan and mix. Add water to thin out the dal at this pont, I added 1 cup water here, you can add as per your taste.
                </li>
                    <li> 10- Add kasuri methi,
                    </li>
                        <li>  11- Also add the chopped cilantro. Add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and mix.
                        </li>
                            <li>  12- Let the dal simmer for 3 to 4 minutes on low-medium heat.
                            </li>
                You can serve the dal at this step or do the extra step of giving it a smokey flavor (dhungar method).
